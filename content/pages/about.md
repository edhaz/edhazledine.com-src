Hi, I'm Ed Hazledine, a self-taught web developer specialising in Python and Flask. 
I'm also a trained violinist, composer, and teacher, having gone to university to study
Music. I've recently started a new [podcast](https://aquestionofcode.com) aiming to help new programmers with commonly asked questions.

I'm currently situated in London, UK.

At the moment I'm open for work.
