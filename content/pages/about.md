Software Developer
---

I used to be a teacher, but decided that wasn't the career for me. The great thing about developing software is anyone can do it if you have the time and energy! I spent two years of evenings, weekends, and holidays learning how to build websites and code using Python, and it paid off! I ended up getting a job using C# and C++ ü§∑ (luckily it does involve some Python). If you're currently in the process of making that career change I'd love to hear from you. See my contact details below or [send me a tweet](https://twitter.com/ed_the_coder)!

I originally started podcasting to become a better coder (and it's still working!) but it's something I really enjoy doing and want to do more of. I co-host my podcast [A Question of Code](https://aqoc.dev) (including doing the editing/promoting) with my brother [Tom](https://tomhazledine.com).
